# External Link Warning

Just a simple jQuery plugin to give users (with JavaScript enabled) a warning before redirecting to an external website.

## Usage

Usage is simple. Simply include the plugin file and then call it:

```js
$(document).externalLinkWarning();
```

Any link clicked on your website that doesn’t match your website’s host name will issue a standard JavaScript confirmation dialog to the user before proceeding.
